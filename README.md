This homework is a showcase of all learnings from Bootcamp Week 1. There are 3 html files and 1 css file. This was exciting in a way that I was eager to see what I've learned. I understand that I have a long way to go, but I'm determined to learn from every mistake.

I started by creating my html content and worked on my css file. Hopefully as time goes, I will be able to perfect techniques and master self-researching methods.
